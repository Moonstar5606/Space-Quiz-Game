#Question 1
answer=input("What does NASA stand for? ")
if answer=="National Aeronautics and Space Administration":
    print("Correct! Yay you got it! :)")

    print("Aw~~~ You got it wrong. :,(")
#Question 2
answer=input("How old is the Universe?")
if answer=="14 billion years":
    print("That's right! The universe is said to be over 14 billion years old")

#Question 3
answer=input("How far is 1 parsec?")
if answer=="3.26 light years":
    print("That's right! A parsec is one of the biggest astronomical units in astronomy. If you thought that a light year was big, imagine that times 3.26")
else:
    print("That is very understandable. Knowing the exact measurements of things is not something that people do often. Now you know> Great job! :D")
#Question 4
print("On that note, let's see if you know the unit for parsec!")
answer=input("What is the astronomical unit for parsec?")
if answer=="pc":
    print("Correct! Just like meter is 'm', and light year is 'ly', parsec's unit is 'pc'. Great Job! :)")
else:
    print("That's understandable. pc for parsecs looks exactly like PC for computers. Isn't it so fun to learn? :D")
#Question 5
answer=input("So. Is astronomy an easy subject to learn?")
if answer=="no":
    print("That is very understandable. Astronomy takes a lot of knowledge of math. You'd have to do some form of calculus every single day. There is always more to learn. If you want to pursue astronomy or anything similar, I hope you do well and continue to learn your math! :)")
if answer=="yes":
    print("I'm glad you think so! Have fun on your journey and enjoy the ride, space ranger! :D")
